        <p>Fried rice is my favorite dish to both make and eat. Such a simple dish elevated by ingredients considered to be "cheap". </p>
        <p>To make fried rice you will cook 1-2 day old rice in a wok over very high heat. Add aromatics and frozen vegatables, alongside a scrambled egg to add brightness and flavor.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cup - day-old rice</li>
            <li>3 tbs - grapeseed oil (or other neutral oil)</li>
            <li>2 tbs - soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 egg - scrambled</li>
            <li>1 tbs - minced ginger</li>
            <li>1 tbs - minced garlic</li>
            <li>12 cup - frozen vegetables</li>
            <li>1 scallion - thinly sliced (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a wok, heat 1 tbs grapeseed oil over high heat until shimmering</li>
            <li>Add the egg and cook for ~1 minute, stirring constantly. Transfer to a small bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tbs until shimmering and add the rice.</li>
            <li>Immediately swirl 1 tbs of soy sauce to around the edge of the wok and begin to coat the rice.</li>
            <li>Allow the rice to cook and form a slight crust before turning again. Repeat until the rice has an even crust and is no longer sizzling.</li>
            <li>Form a whole in the center of the rice and add the last tbs of oil. When hot, add the aromatics and frozen vegetables, stirring constantly for ~30s.</li>
            <li>Add the egg and the last tbs of soy sauce and continue stirring the rice for another 1-2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and serve immediately. Garnish with sliced scallions and season to taste with additional soy sauce.</li>
        </ol>
