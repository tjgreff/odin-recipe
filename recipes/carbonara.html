        <p>Carbonara is a shockingly simple dish that will immediately elevate your weeknight dinner arsenal.". </p>
        <p>Carbonara, at its core, is pasta coated with a mixture of egg and cheese, with some salty pork product to round out the flavor profile. Remember - authentic recipes NEVER use cream!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 lb - dried fettuccine (preferably Dececco brand)</li>
            <li>6 qts - salted water for boiling</li>
            <li>4oz - chopped guanciale (pancetta is a fine substitute)</li>
            <li>2 tbs - olive oil</li>
            <li>3 egg yolks + 1 whole egg</li>
            <li>1/2 cup - grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup - grated romano cheese</li>
            <li>2 tbs - freshly ground pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, combine the eggs with the pepper and cheeses. Mix until uniform and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a high-rimmed pan, add the guanciale and then bring to medium heat.</li>
            <li>Cook the guanciale until golden brown and ~1/4 fat has been rendered out.</li>
            <li>Allow the pan and guanciale to cool slightly before adding the pasta and mixture</li>
            <li>At the same time, bring 6 qts of salted water to a rolling boil.</li>
            <li>Cook the fettuccine until al dente. Transfer from the water immediately to the pan with the guanciale and rendered fat.</li>
            <li>Fold the egg and cheese mixture into the fettuccine. Continue to gently stir until the pasta streaks the bottom of the pan when dragged. The pasta should look creamy and slightly glossy. Add pasta water 1 tbs at a time until the desired consistency is reached.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately in a warmed pasta bowl.</li>
        </ol>
